`ui5-webcomponents-react-seed` deacreases the boostrap time spent on new projects, POCs or MVPs which uses **React + UI5 WebComponents React** by leveraging several out-of-the-box components, scripts & configurations.

# Usage

- open the terminal;
- `npx create-react-app PROJECT_NAME --template ui5-webcomponents-react-seed`;
- cd into `PROJECT_NAME`;
- run `node post_create.js` to add **Husky** and move some dependencies to devDependencies (both are limitations of `create-react-app`)
- (no need to run `yarn install` since it already installs it for you);
- run the available scripts.

PS.: It is important to add the `--template ui5-webcomponents-react-seed` at the end to get our template.

# Configuration Included

- JEST Up & Runnning;

- ESLint & EditorConfig Up & Running;

- CommitLint Up & Running;

- Enviroment Variables Up & Running;

- Internalization Up & Running;

- PR Template;

- IE Support;

- Multiple Scripts.

# Engine & Samples Included

- Fallback Engine (`<ErrorBoundary />`, `<NotFound />` and `<Error />`);

- MockServer Engine (w/ `json-server`);

- API HTTP Request Engine (w/ `Request`, `APIProvider`, `BrowserProvider`);

- Permission Engine (w/ `RouteValidator` and `ComponentValidator`).

- Pagination Engine (w/ custom hook `usePaginatedGet`).

- ToDo Form Edition w/ `yup` and `formik`.

# Hooks Included

# Project Structure

Following one of the several recommendations for structuring files on a React based project, the seed use: [Grouping by file type](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html#grouping-by-file-type).

The only custom change we have incremented were the Custom Components and the folder for each project containing the `tests` artefacts.

# Scripts Included

⚠️ It requires an AppRouter or a BackEnd up & running @ `<domain>:<port>/api`.

### `yarn mock`

Runs the app in the development mode @ [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3000) w/ json-server.

## Testing

### `yarn test`

## Checks

### `yarn lint`

Checks all the files of the project according to the `.eslintrc.js` pre stablished configuration.

### `yarn lint:fix`
